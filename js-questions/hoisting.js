/**
 * 
 * There are 3 types of scope in javascript:
 * Every function creates a block â€” so function scope is a special case of block scope.
But not every block creates a function scope. Only functions do that for var.
 * 1. Global Scope: Variables declared outside any function or block.   ]
 * 2. Function Scope: Variables declared within a function using var, let, or const.
 * 3. Block Scope: Variables declared within a block (enclosed by {}) using let or const.
 * JavaScript uses lexical scoping, meaning variables are resolved by looking at where functions are defined in the code, not where they are called at runtime.
 * var becomes property of window object in global scope and let and const won't
